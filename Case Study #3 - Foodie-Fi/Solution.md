# **Solution**
## A. Customer Journey
Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample subscriptions table below, write a brief description about each customer’s onboarding journey.

**Table: Sample of `subscriptions` table**

**Answer:**

```sql
SELECT
  sub.customer_id,
  plans.plan_id, 
  plans.plan_name,  
  sub.start_date
FROM foodie_fi.plans
JOIN foodie_fi.subscriptions AS sub
  ON plans.plan_id = sub.plan_id
WHERE sub.customer_id IN (1,2,11,13,15,16,18,19);
```

Based on the results above, I have selected three customers to focus on and will now share their onboarding journey.

_(Refer to the table below)_

Customer 1: This customer initiated their journey by starting the free trial on 1 Aug 2020. After the trial period ended, on 8 Aug 2020, they subscribed to the basic monthly plan.

Customer 13: The onboarding journey for this customer began with a free trial on 15 Dec 2020. Following the trial period, on 22 Dec 2020, they subscribed to the basic monthly plan. After three months, on 29 Mar 2021, they upgraded to the pro monthly plan.

Customer 15: Initially, this customer commenced their onboarding journey with a free trial on 17 Mar 2020. Once the trial ended, on 24 Mar 2020, they upgraded to the pro monthly plan. However, the following month, on 29 Apr 2020, the customer decided to terminate their subscription and subsequently churned until the paid subscription ends.

## B. Data Analysis Questions
**1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?**  
Idea: Count distinct `customer_id` values to get the total number of unique customers.  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS unique_customers 
FROM subscriptions;
```
Output:

**2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value**  
Idea: Extract the month from the `start_date` and group by it while filtering for the trial plan.  
```sql
SELECT MONTH(start_date) AS month, COUNT(price) AS monthly_distribute 
FROM subscriptions s 
JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
WHERE plan_name = 'trial' 
GROUP BY MONTH(start_date);
```
Output:

**3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name**  
Idea: Filter `start_date` for values after 2020 and group by `plan_name` for the count.  
```sql
SELECT plan_name, COUNT(*) AS distribute 
FROM subscriptions s 
JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
WHERE YEAR(start_date) > 2020 
GROUP BY plan_name;
```
Output:  
\

**4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?**  
Idea: Filter for churned customers, count them, and calculate the percentage against all unique customers.  
```sql
SELECT plan_name, 
       COUNT(*) AS distribute, 
       ROUND(COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 1) AS "percentage of customers" 
FROM subscriptions s 
JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
WHERE plan_name = 'churn' 
GROUP BY plan_name;
```
Output:  
\

**5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?**  
Idea: Use a window function to identify customers whose next plan after the trial is churn and calculate their percentage.  
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT s.customer_id, 
           p.plan_name, 
           LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.plan_id) AS next_plan 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "customers have churned straight after their initial free trial", 
       ROUND(100 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 0) AS "percentage of customers" 
FROM cte 
WHERE plan_name = 'trial' AND next_plan = 'churn';
```
Output:  
\

**6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?**  
Idea: Use a window function to identify plans that follow a trial and group by those plans.  
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT s.customer_id, 
           p.plan_name, 
           LEAD(p.plan_name) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.plan_id) AS next_plan 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
)
SELECT next_plan, 
       COUNT(*) AS "customers after their initial free trial", 
       ROUND(100 * COUNT(*) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 0) AS "percentage of customers" 
FROM cte 
WHERE plan_name = 'trial' AND next_plan IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY next_plan;
```
Output:  
\

**7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?**  
Idea: Use window functions to track active plans and group by `plan_name` before or after the cutoff date.  
```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT s.customer_id, 
           p.plan_name, 
           LEAD(s.start_date) OVER (PARTITION BY s.customer_id ORDER BY s.start_date) AS next_date 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
)
SELECT plan_name, 
       COUNT(*) AS customers, 
       ROUND(CAST(100 * COUNT(*) AS FLOAT) / (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) FROM subscriptions), 1) AS percentage 
FROM cte 
WHERE (next_date IS NOT NULL AND (start_date < '2020-12-31' AND next_date > '2020-12-31')) 
   OR (next_date IS NULL AND start_date > '2020-12-31') 
GROUP BY plan_name;
```
Output:

**8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?**  
Idea: Filter for customers with `pro annual` plans starting in 2020 and count them.  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_2020_proannual 
FROM subscriptions s 
JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
WHERE plan_name = 'pro annual' AND YEAR(start_date) = 2020;
```
Output:

**9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to move to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?**  
Idea: Calculate the date difference between trial and annual plans for each customer and compute the average.  
```sql
WITH trialplan AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS trial_date 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
    WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
), 
annualplan AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS annual_date 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
    WHERE plan_name = 'pro annual'
)
SELECT AVG(CAST(DATEDIFF(D, trial_date, annual_date) AS FLOAT)) AS avg_date 
FROM trialplan t 
JOIN annualplan a ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id;
```
Output:  
\

**10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30-day periods (i.e., 0-30 days, 31-60 days, etc.)?**  
Idea: Use recursive CTE to define 30-day periods and join with date differences to count customers in each range.  
```sql
WITH trialplan AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS trial_date 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
    WHERE plan_name = 'trial'
), 
annualplan AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS annual_date 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
    WHERE plan_name = 'pro annual'
), 
dateif AS (
    SELECT t.customer_id, DATEDIFF(D, trial_date, annual_date) AS diff 
    FROM trialplan t 
    JOIN annualplan a ON t.customer_id = a.customer_id
), 
cte AS (
    SELECT 0 AS start_period, 30 AS end_period 
    UNION ALL 
    SELECT end_period + 1 AS start_period, end_period + 30 AS end_period 
    FROM cte 
    WHERE end_period < 360
)
SELECT start_period, end_period, COUNT(*) AS amount 
FROM cte 
JOIN dateif d ON d.diff >= start_period AND d.diff <= end_period 
GROUP BY start_period, end_period;
```
Output:

**11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?**  
Idea: Match customers transitioning from `pro monthly` to `basic monthly` and count them.  
```sql
WITH pro_month AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS pro_month_date 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
    WHERE plan_name = 'pro monthly'
), 
basic_month AS (
    SELECT customer_id, start_date AS basic_month_date 
    FROM subscriptions s 
    JOIN plans p ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id 
    WHERE plan_name = 'basic monthly'
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pro_to_basic_monthly 
FROM pro_month p 
JOIN basic_month b ON p.customer_id = b.customer_id AND pro_month_date < basic_month_date 
WHERE YEAR(pro_month_date) = 2020 AND YEAR(basic_month_date) = 2020;
```
